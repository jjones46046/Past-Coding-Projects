# Past-Coding-Projects
This is a repository full of projects I have done over the years to showcase my coding skills in both C++ and Python. A large sum of these projects were done as schoolwork, but I held onto them as references for coding concepts I have learned along the way. 
This repo does not include my most recent work with DTLR as that code is private to the company.
