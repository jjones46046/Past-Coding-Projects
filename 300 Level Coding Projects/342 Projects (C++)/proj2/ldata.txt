Great Expectations<=>
Charles Dickens<=>
I give Pirrip as my father’s family name, on the authority of his tombstone and my sister,—M\
rs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith. As I never saw my father or my mother, and neve\
r saw any likeness of either of them (for their days were long before the days of photograph\
s), my first fancies regarding what they were like were unreasonably derived from their tomb\
stones. The shape of the letters on my father’s, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, s\
tout, dark man, with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription, “Also\
 Georgiana Wife of the Above,” I drew a childish conclusion that my mother was freckled and \
 sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each about a foot and a half long, which were arrange\
 d in a neat row beside their grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of\
  mine,—who gave up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in that universal struggle,—I a\
  m indebted for a belief I religiously entertained that they had all been born on their backs\
   with their hands in their trousers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state of e\
   xistence.

   A TALE OF TWO CITIES<=>
   Charles Dickens<=>
   Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the side of the mail. Al\
   l three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the ears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of th\
   e three could have said, from anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and ea\
   ch was hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from the eyes of t\
   he body, of his two companions. In those days, travellers were very shy of being confidentia\
   l on a short notice, for anybody on the road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As\
    to the latter, when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in “the Captai\
    n's” pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable non-descript, it was the likeliest \
    thing upon the cards. So the guard of the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night i\
    n November, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter's Hill, as he \
    stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet, and keeping an eye and \
    a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eigh\
    t loaded horse-pistols, deposited on a substratum of cutlass.
